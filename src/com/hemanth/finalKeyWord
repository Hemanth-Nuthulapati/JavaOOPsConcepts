Final Keyword:---
The final Keyword has mainly three uses:
    i) Used in Creating constants
    EX:- final int PI = 3.14;
      Note:-
        * final variables must be initialized at the time of declaration like constants
        * convention of final variable is to use all the upper case letters

    ii) If final is used to create methods, then those methods cannot be overridden
    EX:- final void show(){
            System.out.println("This method is not meant for overriding...");
          }

    iii) If final is used to create a class, then those classes cannot be inherited
    EX:- final class SecureClass{
            //Class Body
            }

Note:--
    It is illegal to declare a class as abstract and final because abstract classes
    are meant to be extended, while a final class cannot be extended(inherited)...
