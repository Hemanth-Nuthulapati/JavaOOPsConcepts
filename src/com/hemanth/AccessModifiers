Access Modifiers:--
    * Access Modifiers are also called as access controls or access Specifiers.
    *In java there are mainly four access level controls. They are:
        i) Public
        ii) protected
        iii) Default (or no access modifier)
        iv) private
    * Public:- public members or fields, methods and classes are accessible to everyone that
                means any package can access it.
                ex:- public class ClassName{...}
                     public void methodName(){...}
                     public int variable;
    * Protected:- protected members or fields, methods and classes are accessible to everyone
                  in the package and outside the package no can access it. There is an
                  exception that only subclass can have access to those fields, methods and
                  classes(that means InsidePackageClass is inherited by OutsidePackageClass).
    * Default or no modifier :- default members or fields, methods and classes are accessible
                                to every on in the same package. No one outside the package
                                does not have access.
    * Private:- Private members or fields, methods and classes are accessible to everyone
                only in the particular Class.
