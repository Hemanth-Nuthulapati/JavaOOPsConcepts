Note Points:-
    * class implements interface
    * interface extends interface
    * class extends class

* By default methods interface are abstract
* by default fields or members in interface are final and static
* if want to implement a method in interface then use the following keywords
        * static - because, static methods cannot be overridden, so they should be implemented
                    there itself.
        * default - access modifier
